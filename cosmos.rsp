Response to
Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way" by Kevin Wang
@-------------------------------------------------
I really enjoyed the special effects used in the show, particularly the "ship of imagination", because our future spacecrafts might look like that and the journey that it goes through. I had known that the Universe has existed for a long time, but relating its age to a calendar and seeing that humans barely existed for seconds really put it in a new light. Relating to the size of the Universe, everyone knows about Copernicus and Kepler, but no one talks about Bruno, who really pushed the limits of the size of the Universe. On that note, I like how science is a cooperative discipline, in which generations build upon generations of knowledge. It is also hard to imagine how the moon was ten times brighter than it is now. Another mindblowing fact is that planets outnumber stars, which I still can't bring myself to believe.

Tyson said that imagination alone is not enough because the reality of nature is far more strange than anything we can imagine. I feel this is completely true, but it just makes me want to find out the answers to the mysteries. In addition, I like the idea of a multiverse. Whether or not we can test that theory, or even whether or not it's true, the idea is a cool one. Expect for the story of Bruno, most of the facts I more or less knew, so the question I have is how the special effects were made? What computer graphics methods were utilized?

Episode 3 - "When Knowledge Conquered Fear"
@-------------------------------------------------
Humans like patterns, and want to find patterns to show that they are on earth for a reason.
-They saw the pattern of stars as a calendar, and knew when to migrate / what actinos to take to survive the coming season
-Civilizations all around the world saw comets as portents of doom because they did not follow the patterns that they observed in the stars, and freaked out whenever they saw a comet. It signaled that there would be famine, war, or pestilence. 
-It is important to challenge the norms set in place and to be curious, like Edmond Halley. Halley's curiousity led to him to eventually discover that comets follow a fixed orbit around the earth, and used mathematics to predict when a particular comet (Halley's comet) would reappear in the sky.  
-Halley also had the discernment to meet up with Isaac Newton, who had already discovered the laws of planetary motion but was hiding his proof. This shows the importance of changing up your approach to solving a problem, as Halley realized that his group consisting of Robert Hooke and Christopher Wren was not working.
